Things to do:
- Call score function
- Change constants at the top of endpoint_test.py so they refer to the appropriate values. It may be appropriate to
  use command line parameters or test inputs instead.
- Figure out how to feed Bradley's kill function a process id and test it
- Figure out how to shutdown flask cleanly. There is an attempt in the code (shutodwn_server) which comes from the
    flask documentation, but it doesn't work. There is another idea in the stackoverflow post linked below, so I would
    start by trying that.
